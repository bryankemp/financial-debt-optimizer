Testing & Quality Assurance
===========================

The Financial Debt Optimizer has a comprehensive test suite ensuring reliability and correctness of all financial calculations.

Test Coverage
-------------

Our test suite includes **167 comprehensive tests** covering:

ðŸ§ª **Unit Tests**
   - Core financial calculations and algorithms
   - Data validation and error handling
   - Excel I/O operations
   - Visualization components
   - CLI command functionality

ðŸ”— **Integration Tests**
   - End-to-end workflow testing
   - Excel template â†’ analysis â†’ report generation
   - Multi-strategy comparison workflows
   - Performance testing with large datasets

âš¡ **Performance Tests**
   - Large dataset handling (20+ debts, 10+ expenses)
   - Memory usage stability
   - Processing time benchmarks

ðŸŽ¯ **Validation Tests**
   - Financial scenario validation
   - Data integrity checks
   - Edge case handling

Running Tests
-------------

For developers working on the project:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Install development dependencies
   pip install -e .[dev]
   
   # Run all tests
   pytest
   
   # Run with coverage report
   pytest --cov=debt-optimizer --cov-report=html
   
   # Run specific test categories
   pytest -m unit          # Unit tests only
   pytest -m integration   # Integration tests only
   pytest -m excel        # Excel I/O tests only

Test Categories
---------------

Our tests are organized by functionality:

**Financial Calculations (test_financial_calc.py)**
   Tests for core financial data classes, payment calculations, and interest computations.

**Debt Optimization (test_debt_optimizer.py)**
   Tests for optimization algorithms, strategy comparisons, and result generation.

**Excel I/O (test_excel_io.py)**
   Tests for Excel template generation, data reading, and report writing.

**Validation (test_validation.py)**
   Tests for data validation, error handling, and financial scenario validation.

**CLI Commands (test_cli_commands.py)**
   Tests for command-line interface functionality and user interactions.

**Integration (test_integration.py)**
   End-to-end workflow tests and realistic scenario validation.

**Visualization (test_visualization.py)**
   Tests for chart generation and visualization components.

Quality Metrics
---------------

- **167 tests** with 100% pass rate
- **Comprehensive coverage** of all core functionality
- **Performance benchmarks** for large datasets
- **Realistic scenario testing** with sample financial data
- **Error handling validation** for edge cases

The test suite ensures that all financial calculations are accurate and all features work reliably across different scenarios and data sizes.

Continuous Integration
----------------------

All tests are automatically run on:

- Every pull request
- Every commit to main branch
- Before each release

This ensures that the codebase maintains high quality and reliability standards.
